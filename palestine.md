### West bank (west to Jordan) 
Following the Oslo Accords (1993) and the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (1995), Israel administered only part of it, Zone C (60%), Zone B being jointly administered by Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Area A being entirely under Palestinian control. The Palestinian Authority claims it as part of the State of Palestine. Israel sees it as disputed territory, while part of the international community sees it as occupied territory.

### The gaza band
2 million people, half of whom are 14 years old or less. 70% are refugees (expelled from their land by Israel in 1948 - see Nakba).

He advocates the destruction of the State of Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian Islamic State throughout the territory of the former Mandatory Palestine, before calling for "the establishment of a fully sovereign and independent Palestinian State in the borders of June 4, 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital ”.
In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Hamas defines itself as a movement which finds its principles in the Koran and fights in the name of Islam. Hamas militants, including those in the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, target both the military and Israeli civilians. Between April 1993 and 2005, Hamas organized suicide attacks targeting mainly civilians. The last suicide bombing against Israel claimed by Hamas dates back to January 2005; he declared in April 2006 to renounce this type of actions, preferring to fire Qassam-type rockets and Grad missiles at Israeli towns, including Sderot, Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beer Sheva.

Fatah (Arabic: فتح ie conquest) is a movement for the liberation of Palestine founded by Yasser Arafat in Kuwait in 1959.

The PLO is made up of several Palestinian organizations, including Fatah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP).
Since its inception, the PLO, which includes political institutions, has presented itself as an armed resistance movement representing the Palestinians.

## Geopolitics

### 3 Actors

Successive Israeli governments, the Palestinian government (from the PLO) and Hamas.

### The blockade of the Gaza Strip
The blockade of the Gaza Strip refers to the most recent blockade of the Gaza Strip imposed by Israel and Egypt since its takeover by Hamas in June 2007. On June 14, 2007, following a power between Hamas and Fatah, Hamas, which won the legislative elections of January 2006, rules the Gaza Strip, completely ousting Fatah from the territory.
Consequences: massive poverty (56%) and unemployment (82%), no access to basic food for the population (50% depend on food packages), Israel carries out military attacks causing thousands of deaths among the Gazans. No water, no gas, no access to on-site care (must go to Israel but blocked regularly).
"An open-air prison", the largest in the world. Today there are only 2 passages: one to Egypt (Rafah) and the other to East Jerusalem and the West Bank (Beit Hanoun (Erez)).

### Sheikh Jarrah (2021)
Sheikh Jarrah (Arabic: الشيخ جراح, Hebrew: שייח 'ג'ראח, English: Sheikh Jarrah) is a predominantly Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem, north of the Old City (28 Palestinian families, 550 people).
Since April 2021, forced evictions have been decided in court (leaving his house within the month and paying $ 20k in +) and massive violence has taken place in this neighborhood. It's part of Israel's ethnic cleansing process.

## Important historical elements

### Nakba
The Palestinian exodus of 1948 refers to the exodus of the Palestinian Arab population that took place during the Israeli-Arab war of 1948. The event remains in Palestinian collective memory as Nakba (Arabic: النكبة, al -Nakbah, lit. “disaster” or “disaster”). During this war, between 700000 and 750,000, Palestinian Arabs are displaced by the end of the war and find themselves refugees in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and neighboring countries, mainly in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The nakba created the Palestinian diaspora (1/3 refugees in the world are Palestinian). The nakba is not only an event of the past, it is something that continues even today.

### 6 Day War
The Six Day War took place from Monday June 5 to Saturday June 10, 1967 and pitted Israel against Egypt, Jordan and Syria.
In less than a week, the Hebrew state tripled its territorial grip: Egypt lost the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula, Syria was amputated from the Golan Heights and Jordan from the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

### 1st intifada
The first intifada, also known as the Stone War, refers to the period of conflict between the Palestinians of the occupied territories and Israel, from December 9, 1987, which ended in 1993, with the signing of the Oslo Accords.
It is marked by the uprising of the Palestinian population and is characterized by violent riots and by the repression of the Israeli army.

### 2nd intifada
The Second Intifada or Intifada el-Aqsa (Arabic: الإنتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية or إنتفاضة الأقصى; Hebrew: אינתיפאדת אל-אקצה) refers to the period of Israeli-Palestinian violence from September 2000 until approximately February 2005.
The intifada began on September 29 2000, two months after the failure of the Oslo Process (specifically the Camp David (II) Summit) and immediately following Ariel Sharon's provocative visit (flanked by 1,000 police) to the politically and religiously charged Temple Mount / Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem. No clear ending.

## Solutions

### Binational state = 1 state solution
In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the expression binational state, or one-state solution (as opposed to the two-state solution) refers to a motion for a resolution, consisting in the creation of a single state for which two nationalities would be constitutionally defined, of which current Israelis and Palestinians would all be citizens, similarly to Lebanon.

### 2-state solution
The two-state solution is a consensus solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, discussed by the main parties to the conflict within the framework of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, notably at the Annapolis conference in November 2007. It proposes the creation two separate states in the geographic region of Palestine, one Arab and the other Jewish. It opposes the one-state solution, known as the "binational state," in which Israelis and Palestinians would live.
In practice, the extension of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem greatly compromises this solution (because no separable zones, everything is intertwined), but the 1967 borders could be used to enforce it.

### 3-state solution (s)
This alternative proposes, according to The New-York Times, the attribution of the West Bank to Jordan and of the Gaza Strip to Egypt. There would also be another 3-state solution: Israel, Palestine and neutral Jerusalem.

### From the river to the sea
From the River to the Sea (Arabic: min al-nahr ila al-bahr) is and is part of a popular political slogan used by some Palestinian nationalists. It contains the idea that the lands located between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea would be entirely placed under Arab domination at the expense of the State of Israel, excluding the disputed Golan Heights, conquered in 1967 by Syria and annexed. unilaterally in 1981. It was used frequently by Arab leaders and is often chanted during anti-Israel protests.
Only 13% of Palestinians think it involves ousting Jews, so for a large majority it would amount to a binational (1-state) state solution, if I understand correctly.

### Stateless solution
Not really feasible at the moment but it is the wish of the anarchists in the long term. Global and stateless socialism.
